TIH Internship – Data Cleaning & Regression
📌 Overview

This internship project focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling. The tasks guide you through handling missing values, analyzing datasets, visualizing distributions, and applying regression techniques to derive insights.

🎯 Objectives

Learn data cleaning techniques (handling missing values, replacing values, filling with mean/median/mode).

Explore datasets using statistical summaries and visualizations.

Perform feature engineering to prepare datasets for modeling.

Apply regression models to predict outcomes.

📝 Tasks

Data Cleaning

Insert synthetic missing values.

Replace missing values with chosen strategies (mean, median, custom value).

Handle missing values column-wise.

Data Exploration

Show dataset statistics for numerical columns.

Check and report data types.

Display dataset shape and structure.

Data Visualization

Plot the distribution of price in the dataset.

Plot the distribution of total area (sum of basement + other areas).

Explore correlation between features.

Regression Analysis

Apply linear regression to predict house prices.

Train-test split for model evaluation.

Report model accuracy and performance metrics.

⚙️ Requirements
